# Credits and third-party licences

The theme's own source — components, layouts, pages, styles, TypeScript, demo
copy, the icon sprite, the project artwork and the monogram — is MIT licensed.
See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

Everything bundled from elsewhere is listed below with its own licence.

## Photographs

All twelve photographs in `public/images/` come from
[Pxhere](https://pxhere.com/). Pxhere's
[licence page](https://pxhere.com/en/license) states that every photo on the
site is released under the
[Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licence](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/):

> The pictures are free for personal and even for commercial use. You can
> modify, copy and distribute the photos. All without asking for permission or
> setting a link to the source. So, attribution is not required.

They are credited here anyway, so anyone can check a source for themselves.

The files shipped in this repository are not the originals. Each one was
cropped to the aspect ratio the layout needs and re-encoded as WebP.

If you keep the demo photographs, nothing is required of you. If you replace
them — which you should, for a real portfolio — delete the rows above and
record whatever your own images need.

> **A note on the people in these photographs.** Pxhere attaches one condition
> to its CC0 release: *"identifiable people may not appear in a bad light or in
> a way that they may find offensive, unless they give their consent."*
>
> Four of the twelve images show identifiable people. The demo content presents
> them as a fictional portfolio owner and fictional clients, in a neutral,
> professional light — which stays inside that condition. Keep it that way if
> you keep the photographs.
>
> Separately, CC0 waives copyright; it is not a model release. Before using a
> photograph of an identifiable person in advertising, or in a way that implies
> a real person endorses you, make sure you have the rights you need.
> Replacing the demo photographs with your own avoids the question entirely.

## Fonts

Both families are bundled as self-hosted WOFF2 variable fonts in
`public/fonts/`, so no request ever leaves your domain for a font.

| Family | Files | Licence | Upstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Space Grotesk | `space-grotesk-latin.woff2`, `space-grotesk-latin-ext.woff2` | [SIL Open Font License 1.1](public/fonts/OFL-SpaceGrotesk.txt) | [floriankarsten/space-grotesk](https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk) |
| Inter Tight | `inter-tight-latin.woff2`, `inter-tight-latin-ext.woff2` | [SIL Open Font License 1.1](public/fonts/OFL-InterTight.txt) | [rsms/inter-tight](https://github.com/rsms/inter-tight) |

The OFL permits bundling and redistribution with a project, including
commercially, provided the licence text travels with the fonts — which is why
`OFL-SpaceGrotesk.txt` and `OFL-InterTight.txt` sit beside them. Do not sell
the font files on their own, and do not rename the families.

Only the `latin` and `latin-ext` subsets are included. If you need Cyrillic,
Greek or Vietnamese, download those subsets from the upstream projects, drop
them in `public/fonts/`, and add matching `@font-face` blocks with the right
`unicode-range` in `src/styles/fonts.css`.

## Icons and artwork

Every icon and every piece of artwork in this theme was drawn for it. There is
no icon-library dependency.

| Asset | Where |
| --- | --- |
| 29-icon sprite | `src/components/icons/IconSprite.astro` |
| Booklet and tablet mockups | `src/components/art/BookletMock.astro`, `TabletMock.astro` |
| Project artwork (identity, dashboard, app screens) | `src/components/art/IdentityArt.astro`, `DashboardArt.astro`, `AppScreensArt.astro` |
| Signature mark | `src/components/art/Signature.astro` |
| Client wordmarks | `src/data/clients.ts` (inline SVG, fictional companies) |
| Monogram, favicon, app icons, OG image | `public/favicon.svg`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/icon-192.png`, `public/icon-512.png`, `public/og-default.png` |
| README preview screenshot | `public/preview.png` (a render of this theme) |

All of it is MIT along with the rest of the theme: use it, change it, ship it.

## Dependencies

| Package | Licence |
| --- | --- |
| [astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro) | MIT |
| [@astrojs/sitemap](https://github.com/withastro/astro) | MIT |
| [@astrojs/rss](https://github.com/withastro/astro) | MIT |
| [@astrojs/check](https://github.com/withastro/astro) | MIT |
| [typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) | Apache-2.0 |

## Demo content

Every name in the demo content is fictional: the portfolio owner (Robin Vale /
Vale Studio), the clients (Brightsill, Tessellate, Coalfield, Petrichor,
Saltmarsh, Undergrove, Meridian), the people quoted in the testimonials, and
the awards. The case-study figures are illustrative, not records of real
projects. The email address, phone number and postal details are placeholders.

Replace all of it before you publish. `src/config/site.ts` is the place to
start; the README has the full list.
